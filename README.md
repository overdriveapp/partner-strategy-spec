# Overdrive Strategy Specification

This repository contains the standard template used by Overdrive
to collect, evaluate, and implement partner trading strategies.

Partners are invited to define their strategy logic using the
provided template. Overdrive will assess feasibility and implement
an MVP version where appropriate.

## 📋 How to Submit a Strategy

1. **Download** or copy the [`strategy-template.md`](./strategy-template.md)
2. **Fill out** all sections as completely as possible
3. **Review** the checklist at the end to ensure nothing is missing
4. **Send** the completed document back through our established communication channel
